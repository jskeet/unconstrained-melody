Full documentation may come later, if there's enough demand.

For the moment, read this blog post:
http://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2009/09/10/generic-constraints-for-enums-and-delegates/

Then if you just want the library, install the NuGet package:
http://nuget.org/List/Packages/UnconstrainedMelody

Or if you want the "Constraint Changer" to write your own generic members
in the same way, build the source code from the project home page:
http://code.google.com/p/unconstrained-melody/

Email me with any queries, questions, etc. (Or use the issue tracker to report bugs.)
